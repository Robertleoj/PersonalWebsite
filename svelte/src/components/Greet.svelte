            Since I started programming, I've been obsessed. I've worked all around the web development stack, and beyond it. Now I'm focusing on finishing my Bachelor's degree in Discrete mathematics and Computer Science.
            <br><br>
            I'm a very fast learner, and constantly trying to learn more about my craft, improving my skills every day. There's nothing I enjoy more.
