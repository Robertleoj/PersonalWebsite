            Since I started programming, I've been obsessed. I've worked all around the web development stack, and beyond it. Now I'm focusing on finishing my Bachelor's degree in Discrete mathematics and Computer Science.

            I'm a very fast learner, and constantly trying to learn more about my craft, improving my skills every day. There's nothing I enjoy more.
